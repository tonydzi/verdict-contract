# Seven rounds to a verdict

*How two vendor models spent an afternoon proving our review gate was lying, and what
survived.*

## The setup

We run a two-vendor review gate. Every executable change one of our agents makes gets
handed to a model from a *different* vendor with instructions to break it. The theory
is old and sound: your own blind spots are not randomly distributed, so a second pair
of eyes from a different training run finds what you structurally cannot.

The gate worked like almost every homegrown gate does. The prompt ended with "finish
your reply with `VERDICT: APPROVE` or `VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES`", and a regex fished
that line back out of the reply.

Then the operator asked a four-word question: **"is the root fixed?"**

We had a green test. The honest move was not to point at it. We handed the parser to
both vendors and asked them to try to break it.

Both came back independently with the same answer: `ROOT-FIXED: NO`.

## Round 1: the regex was not a contract

The findings were not style notes. Every one came with a reply string that reproduced
live:

**The docstring promised a protection that did not exist.** It said "no newline
allowed in the gap" between the word and the value. The gap class was `\s`. `\s`
includes `\n`. So:

```
I refuse to give a VERDICT
APPROVE would be wrong
```

parsed as **APPROVE**. A refusal to judge, read as a pass. And the comment above the
code confidently described a guard that was never there, which is the same class of
silent lie the parser itself was supposed to prevent.

**A quoted example shipped as a real verdict.** `Example output: VERDICT: APPROVE` -
APPROVE. Any reviewer that explained the format while declining to use it approved
the diff.

**The prompt poisoned itself.** Our own instruction text contained both literals. A
model that paraphrased its instructions back at us parsed as a verdict about the code.

**"One copy" was a lie.** A third call site had quietly kept its own divergent
parser, with different semantics. Three reviews of one report could produce two
different verdicts and nobody would see the disagreement.

**And the verdict never reached the exit code.** It went to `print`. Automation read
"the process exited 0" as "the review passed". A reviewer that crashed mid-sentence
after writing a blocking review counted as a pass. A reviewer that said nothing
useful counted as a pass.

That last one is the whole category, and it generalizes past code review: **a gate
whose verdict lives only in stdout is not a gate. It is a log line.**

## The fix had to be structural

The tempting move is a smarter regex. Add a negative lookahead for "Example", exclude
lines starting with quote markers, tighten the gap class. That road has no end; every
patch is one adversarial reply away from the next hole, and each patch makes the next
person less able to reason about the whole.

So we changed what the thing *is*. Not "guess the content of a line" but "the model
signs a structured marker, and everything else is a contract violation":

1. **A sentinel line.** `===VERDICT=== <value>`, alone, as the final line. The parser
   matches whole lines only, so prose cannot glue into a verdict and the newline gap
   is impossible by construction rather than by promise.
2. **A closed enum with an explicit AMBIGUOUS.** `APPROVE` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
   Anything else is loud, never a guess and never a quiet fail-safe.
3. **The prompt rule and the parser live in the same file.** Two copies of a contract
   are one edit away from silently disagreeing. Callers import the rule; they never
   retype it.
4. **The verdict maps to the exit status.** `0` / `3` / `4`. Automation can no longer
   confuse output with approval.

And the piece that stopped the self-poisoning: the instruction spells the value as
`<value>`, so the instruction text contains no line the parser can match. Our own
prompt is inert. There is a test that asserts exactly that.

## Rounds 2 through 7: the fix was wrong four more times

Here is the part worth the read. We sent *the fix itself* through the same two-vendor
gate. Each round found a genuinely new hole in code we already believed was correct.

**Junk poisons an approve - but only if you detect it.** `===VERDICT=== REJECT` is
outside the enum, so it is a broken contract, not a verdict. Fine. But the detection
regex included the value class, so a *malformed* value like `REJECT!` did not register
as a sentinel at all. Which meant:

```
===VERDICT=== REJECT!
===VERDICT=== APPROVE
```

read as a clean APPROVE. The reviewer had rejected the change and the gate approved
it. The fix: detection must be **broader** than validation. Stage one detects a marker
with any remainder; stage two validates the value. Anything that looks like a verdict
counts as one, even when it is malformed - *especially* when it is malformed.

**Position had to be enforced, not requested.** `===VERDICT=== APPROVE` followed by
"Actually, this has a serious bug" was still an approve. Now an APPROVE is clean only
as the single sentinel on the final non-blank line. Everything else is AMBIGUOUS.

**And then the one that could only happen live.** Mid-review, a vendor wrote a finding
*about fences*, and to do so it quoted a bare ` ``` ` **inside** a ` ```text ` block.
Our fence tracker desynced. A quoted APPROVE became "visible" and the real final
`REQUEST_CHANGES` got swallowed. The gate reported APPROVE for a review that had just
rejected the diff - during the review of the very fix meant to prevent that.

The lesson is not "fix the fence tracker". **Fence detection is undecidable on nested
or unbalanced fences.** Any parser whose correctness depends on knowing whether a line
sits inside a fence has a hole you cannot close, only move.

So the strict layer stopped looking at fences entirely. It reads raw lines. Safety
comes from three properties that survive quoting:

- **Position** - an approve must be the last non-blank line.
- **Uniqueness** - an approve must be the only sentinel in the reply.
- **Asymmetry** - blocking wins from anywhere, including from inside a quote.

That last one is the design, not a compromise. **A false block costs a re-read. A
false approve ships a bug.** When those two errors have different prices, the parser
should not be symmetric. So a quoted `REQUEST_CHANGES` blocks, and we accept the
occasional needless re-read as the cheap side of the trade.

Round seven: `APPROVE` from both vendors, exit 0 from both.

## What it cost, and what it bought

Seven rounds, four real holes in code that had already passed its own green test.
Fourteen days later the module is unchanged and gating every review across a
six-machine fleet.

The strongest evidence is indirect. Nine days after the fix we added a *third* vendor
rail. The engineer building it - a different agent, different session, no memory of
this one - imported the shared contract instead of writing a fourth parser. "One copy"
stopped being a claim in a docstring and became a property of the codebase.

Three things we would carry to any gate, not just this one:

1. **A green test you wrote is evidence about your imagination, not about your code.**
   The question "is the root fixed?" is answered by an adversary, not by your suite.
2. **Ask the second opinion to review the fix, not just the bug.** Four of the five
   real findings arrived *after* we thought we were done.
3. **When your two error directions have different costs, say so in the code.** Most
   parsers are accidentally symmetric because nobody wrote down which mistake is
   expensive.

The module is ~190 lines, stdlib only, MIT:
**[github.com/tonydzi/verdict-contract](https://github.com/tonydzi/verdict-contract)**

Every counterexample above is a case in the test file. If you find a reply string it
reads wrong, open an issue with the verbatim text - that is the most valuable thing
you can send us, and it is how every case in there arrived.
